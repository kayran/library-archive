# library-archive

This is a project made in my Front-end Development MBA. It just create a simple library archive where you can add, list and remove books.

This is part of Javascript Architecture - AJS-201A course.

This project was generated with REACT, using redux, axios and a backend with JSON-SERVER

## Install

Clone the project. 
Enter the react-app folder and run `npm install`.
Enter the backend folder and run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` (if the project doesn't auto open). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run the server from backend folder with `npm start` for a json server. The server will automatically reload when data changes.
